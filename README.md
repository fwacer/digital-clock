Digital clock project using an Arduino Nano and seven-segment display

Goal: To make a digital clock displayed on LEDs (not allowed to use pre-built seven-segment displays), which is run on an arduino nano. The final product should have no breadboard connections, and only have one wire exposed, which is the power wire that goes to the wall.
